Here  I have to print all the path from root node to leaf nodes

For this we can use any traversal tree what we have to do 
is to check if root is not null then push it into map/vector
and if root is leaf node print the element present in vector/map

Now when we traverse the whole left child and right child of root
element we simply removes the root element from vector/map

Code:
if(root==NULL)
return;
mp[root->val]++;
if(isLeafNode){
    traverse map and print node
}
else{
    traverse(leftchild);
    traverse(rightchild);
}
after traversing the child of root node remove the root elemnent
mp[root->val]--; backtracking things
